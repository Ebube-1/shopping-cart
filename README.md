# Shopping Cart Application

This is a simple shopping cart application built with React.js, designed to allow users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, manage quantities, apply a discount coupon, and view the total cost. The cart persists in `localStorage`, so items remain in the cart even after page refreshes.

## Features

- Display a list of 10 products, each with a name and price.
- Add products to the cart.
- Update item quantity in the cart.
- Remove items from the cart.
- View the total number of items and the total cost of the cart.
- Apply a discount code (`WEB3BRIDGECOHORTx`) for a 10% discount on the total price.
- Cart persists on page refresh using `localStorage`.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS for styling
- `localStorage` for cart persistence
